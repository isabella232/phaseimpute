name: "vcf_normalize_bcftools"
description: Normalize VCF files (bcftools norm -m +any). Combine records spanning different lines into a single line.
  Keep only biallelic SNPs and remove multiallelic records (bcftools view -m 2 -M 2 -v snps).
  Convert to hap/legend format (bcftools convert --haplegendsample).
  Optionally, remove samples from the reference panel (bcftools view -s ^SAMPLENAME).

        Reference panel of haplotypes in VCF/BCF format.
        Index file of the Reference panel file.
        Target region, usually a full chromosome (e.g. chr20:1000000-2000000 or chr20).
        The file could possibly be without GT field (for efficiency reasons a file containing only the positions is recommended).
